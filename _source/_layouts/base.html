Our sweet spot is B and C class properties with 20 to 75 units, typically garden-style or townhouse construction from the 1980s or newer. We target family-oriented unit mixes with predominantly 2 and 3 bedroom layouts, as these generate stable demand from working families seeking affordable housing in suburban Portland markets."

            "text": "B and C class properties offer several advantages in the current Portland market. They serve the workforce housing segment with consistent demand regardless of economic cycles. These properties typically offer better cash flow and in-place yields compared to luxury apartments. There's less new construction competition at this price point, and B and C properties offer more value-add opportunities through modest renovations and improved management."

For most acquisitions, we secure conventional multifamily loans through local and regional banks. When sellers have existing favorable financing—particularly low fixed-rate loans—we prioritize assuming those loans. Our conservative leverage approach targets maximum 75% loan-to-value."
