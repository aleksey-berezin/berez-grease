        <p class="section-text line-length-lg mb-lg">
          The Portland metro area offers solid fundamentals for multifamily investors. Demand is outpacing new supply, vacancy is coming down, and rent growth is on track to recover. Here's what the numbers look like:
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="portland-prose">
          <p><strong>Supply is drying up.</strong> Construction has dropped from 13,000 units in 2022 to under 2,000 today. Portland is heading into its slowest delivery year since 2011. Less competition means better occupancy for existing properties.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Demand stays strong.</strong> Over 5,300 units were absorbed in the last 12 months — well above the 4,000 delivered. Renters are moving to affordable East Portland submarkets like Gresham and Troutdale for value and space.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Rents are recovering.</strong> After a soft 2023, rent growth is turning positive. The forecast calls for around 2% growth by the end of 2026. Mid-range properties (3 Star) are outperforming luxury in both occupancy and stability.</p>

        <p class="section-text line-length-lg">
          <strong>Property management is the foundation of successful multifamily investing.</strong> While many investors treat management as an afterthought, we view it as central to our value creation strategy. The right management partner directly impacts tenant satisfaction, operational efficiency, and ultimately, our returns.
        </p>
        
        <p class="section-text line-length-lg">
          Our approach is rooted in <strong>active oversight combined with experienced third-party execution</strong>. We don't simply hand properties over to a management company and hope for the best. Instead, we maintain close involvement in strategic decisions while leveraging professional management expertise for day-to-day operations.

            <h4>Resident Quality</h4>
            <p>We prioritize stable, long-term residents over maximizing occupancy at any cost. Careful tenant screening, responsive maintenance, and fair treatment create communities where people want to stay.</p>

          <div class="approach-card">

            <h4>Data-Driven Decisions</h4>

            <summary class="faq-question">What types of properties does Berez Investment Group acquire?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>We focus exclusively on multifamily properties—apartment buildings and townhome communities—in the Portland Metro area. Our sweet spot is B and C class properties with 20 to 75 units, typically garden-style or townhouse construction from the 1980s or newer. We target family-oriented unit mixes with predominantly 2 and 3 bedroom layouts, as these generate stable demand from working families seeking affordable housing in suburban Portland markets.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Why do you focus on B and C class apartments instead of luxury properties?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>B and C class properties offer several advantages in the current Portland market. First, they serve the workforce housing segment, which has consistent demand regardless of economic cycles. Working families need affordable, quality housing—that demand doesn't disappear during downturns. Second, these properties typically offer better cash flow and in-place yields compared to luxury apartments, which often sacrifice yield for appreciation potential. Third, there's less new construction competition at this price point, as developers focus on higher-end projects. Finally, B and C properties offer more value-add opportunities through modest renovations and improved management, allowing us to increase rents while still maintaining affordability.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">What geographic areas do you invest in?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Our primary focus is East Portland and the inner-ring suburbs: Gresham, Troutdale, and Fairview. These markets offer strong fundamentals including good schools, transportation access, and employment centers, while maintaining relative affordability compared to central Portland. We also consider opportunities in Clackamas County and Washington County when they meet our acquisition criteria. We avoid central Portland's urban core due to higher acquisition costs, rent control concerns, and weaker cash-on-cash returns. Our target markets have limited new construction pipelines, stable demographics, and room for rent growth as Portland's affordability challenges push residents eastward.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">How do you finance property acquisitions?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>We use a combination of conventional financing and assumable loans when available. For most acquisitions, we secure conventional multifamily loans through local and regional banks that understand the Portland market. These typically require 25-30% down payment and offer 20-25 year amortization. When sellers have existing favorable financing—particularly low fixed-rate loans originated before interest rates rose—we prioritize assuming those loans to maintain advantageous terms. We also evaluate properties with Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae agency debt that can be assumed. Our conservative leverage approach targets maximum 75% loan-to-value, ensuring we maintain sufficient equity cushion and cash flow even if market conditions soften.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">What returns do you target on acquisitions?</summary>

              <p>We target minimum 6% cap rates on acquisition, with cash-on-cash returns in the 7-10% range depending on leverage and value-add potential. Our investment thesis prioritizes stable cash flow and long-term wealth preservation over speculative appreciation. We underwrite conservatively, assuming modest 2-3% annual rent growth and budgeting for realistic vacancy and maintenance costs. Our hold period is typically 7-10 years, though we're prepared to hold longer if market conditions warrant. The combination of cash flow, mortgage paydown, and moderate appreciation has historically generated attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining downside protection.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">Do you accept outside investors or operate as a fund?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Currently, Berez Investment Group operates as a private investment company focused on our own capital deployment. We are not structured as a fund and do not solicit outside investors. Our boutique approach allows us to move quickly on acquisitions, maintain operational flexibility, and take a truly long-term view without external pressure for distributions or exits. If you're interested in discussing potential partnership opportunities on specific deals, we're open to conversations on a case-by-case basis for qualified partners who share our investment philosophy.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">What is your typical renovation and repositioning timeline?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Our value-add timeline depends on the property's condition and scope of improvements needed. For light renovations—updating unit interiors with new flooring, paint, fixtures, and appliances—we typically complete work as units turn over naturally, spreading improvements over 12-24 months. This approach minimizes vacancy loss while capturing rent increases incrementally. For more extensive repositioning including exterior improvements, amenity upgrades, or common area renovations, we front-load capital investment in the first 6-12 months after acquisition. Major projects like siding replacement, parking lot repaving, or amenity additions happen during favorable weather and are planned to minimize disruption to residents. Our goal is value creation through steady improvement, not aggressive flip strategies that sacrifice quality or resident experience.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">How do you handle property management?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>We partner with experienced third-party property management companies that specialize in workforce housing in the Portland market. Professional management handles day-to-day operations including tenant screening, rent collection, maintenance coordination, and lease enforcement. However, we maintain active oversight through monthly financial reviews, quarterly property inspections, and approval authority over major decisions including capital expenditures, significant vendor contracts, and strategic initiatives. This hybrid approach combines professional management expertise with hands-on ownership involvement, ensuring properties are well-maintained while operating efficiently.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">Are you actively looking to buy more properties right now?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. We are actively seeking acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria. The current market presents compelling opportunities as interest rate increases have slowed transaction volume, creating less competition for well-located, cash-flowing properties. We're particularly interested in properties with assumable low-rate financing, deferred maintenance that we can address through our renovation expertise, or operational inefficiencies that can be improved through better management. If you have a property that fits our acquisition criteria—or know of one coming to market—we'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a potential transaction.</p>
